## Soon: Special TeX Hour with Jonathan Godfrey

In late November or early December there will be a special TeX Hour,
focussed on LaTeX and Accessibility. We're pleased that Jonathan
Godfrey, a blind senior lecturer in Statistics and stalwart of the
Blind Math list, will be one of our special guests. We hope to make an
announcement here early October.

### Large and small

**Jonathan Fine:** Large and small are in fact relative terms. This is
well expressed by the phrase "a big fish in a small pond", which means
a person who is well known and important in a small group, but not in
any larger group.

This TeX Hour is about taking advantage of the large lake, sea, ocean
or cloud that now exist (and letting go of the false comfort and
security that comes from holding on to the past).

### My first and present PCs

When I bought my first PC, in 1989, TeX was a big piece of software. I
payed extra to get a faster CPU and disk, and more RAM. Yes, I bought
a 10Mhz 80286 with a 40MB disk (28 millisecond access time) and 2MB of
RAM. I didn't have enough money for an 80386. It was adequate for
perhaps 10 years.

My current PC has a 12 core 4.9 GHz CPU with 72MB of cache, 2TB of
NVMe memory and 64GB of RAM. I hope it remains adequate for another 10
years. Even my mobile phone dwarfs my original PC. And it downloads a
40MB app wirelessly in less than a minute.

The result of this big change, together with the growth in open
source, is the TeX nows shares the 'pond' that is the PC with lots and
lots of other software. Don Knuth and others worked hard to fit TeX's
marvellous typesetting into my first PC and similar machines. From
1989 I've been most grateful for this work, even though some of it is
today obsolete.

### LibreOffice and a modular TeX

This change in environment is both a threat and an opportunity. It
took my browser a minute to download and launch the 300MB WASM version
of LibreOffice. So why can't we have a TeX, bigger than TeX in 1989
but smaller than LibreOffice, that downloads and launches in 10
seconds!

This would allow TeX to be a stable component readily available to be
incorporated into larger systems. This is much closer to the Unix
philosophy of modular and reusable components. SQLite is a lovely
example of such a component, and is deservedly "the most widely
deployed database engine".

Don Knuth wrote TeX at a time when only a monolith would allow him to
produce an archival and high quality typesetting system. That said,
his original conception was that TeX would be "just a typesetting
language". In some sense he "put in many of TeX’s programming features
only after kicking and screaming".

### TeX Forever!

This is the title of a talk I gave at the 2005 EuroTeX at
Pont-à-Mousson, whose focus is "new ways of doing input to and output
from TEX. These new ways bypass our current habits, and provide fresh
opportunities". Largely this article has been ignored, and much of it
is more relevant now than it was then. See URLs for a link (PDF).

By the way, in 1951 the young and now eminent mathematician Alexander
Grothendieck (1928--2014) took a cycling tour that included
Pont-à-Mousson. The URLs give a nice photo of him with perhaps a steel
works in the background. I owe a lot to his mathematical
contributions. (Today a 1970s blast furnace in Redcar, Teeside, UK was
demolished - see URLs.)

### Closing remarks

Perhaps by making TeX small again we can regain the excitement of
innovation that existed in the 1980s when TeX emerged from the
computer laboratory and into the world of STEM publishing and other
areas. Some reinvention is required to retain relevance.

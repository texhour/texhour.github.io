This special meeting of the TeX Hour is fortunate to have **three**
special guests:

- [Peter Williams](https://newton.cx/~peter/) will speak about
Tectonic
- [Martin Ruckert](https.//www.cs.hm.edu/~ruckert) will speak about
HINT
- [Dennis Müller](https://kwarc.info/people/dmueller/) will speak about sTeX

{% include see_about.html %}

Here's a brief introduction to these new and interesting systems:

- [Semantic TeX (sTeX)](https://kwarc.info/systems/sTeX/) provides a
LaTeX environment that captures both the appearance and meaning of
mathematical writing, and provides both PDF and semantic HTML5 output.
- [HINT](https://hint.userweb.mwn.de/) provides a standard for and software to typeset and view
typeset material that can be reflowed and repaginated under the
reader's control.
- [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) repackages and
develops XeTeX to provide an improved user and developer experience,
and high quality HTML5 output for readers (in addition to PDF).

This TeX Hour has two parts. The first hour will be presentations
followed by a panel discussion, with audience questions and
contributions. The second hour, which is optional, will be more like a
workshop. If numbers require we will break into small groups of about
8.

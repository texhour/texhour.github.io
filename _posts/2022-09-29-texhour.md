This special meeting of the TeX Hour was fortunate to have **three**
special guests:

- [Peter Williams](https://newton.cx/~peter/) spoke about
Tectonic
- [Martin Ruckert](https://www.cs.hm.edu/~ruckert) spoke about
HINT
- [Dennis Müller](https://kwarc.info/people/dmueller/) spoke about sTeX

Here's a brief introduction to these new and interesting systems:

- [Semantic TeX (sTeX)](https://kwarc.info/systems/sTeX/) provides a
LaTeX environment that captures both the appearance and meaning of
mathematical writing, and provides both PDF and semantic HTML5 output.
- [HINT](https://hint.userweb.mwn.de/) provides a standard for and software to typeset and view
typeset material that can be reflowed and repaginated under the
reader's control.
- [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) repackages and
develops XeTeX to provide an improved user and developer experience,
and high quality HTML5 output for readers (in addition to PDF).

This TeX Hour had two parts. The first hour was presentations
followed by a panel discussion.The second hour was a lively and friendly discussion with about 12 participants. You can [watch the video here]({% post_url 2022-09-29-bonus-texhour %}).

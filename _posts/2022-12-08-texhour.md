### Why survey vector graphics?

**Jonathan Fine:** Briefly, because Adobe's PostScript (1982) and its
offspring PDF (1993) no longer rule dominate as once they did. The new
millenium (2001) saw Scalable Vector Graphics from the W3C. And now
PDF and HTML5 (including SVG) have similar importance.

More broadly, 'digital typography' today equally embraces PDF and
browser.  This TeX Hour presents the outcome of a rough survey of
vector graphic. I hope others will contribute.

### Background

Problems in `dvisvgm` have prompted this TeX Hour. The problems arise
from changes in `Ghostscript`, which in turn arise from security (and
performance and support) problems in PostScript. Another concern is
that HTML5 now dominates PDF in many areas. See for example Paged.js,
which is

> a free and open source JavaScript library that paginates content in
  the browser to create PDF output from any HTML content.

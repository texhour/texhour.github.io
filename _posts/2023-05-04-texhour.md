### Summary


**Jonathan Fine**

On 30 April 1993 CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) put
into the public domain the World Wide Web (so called) software that
Tim Berner-Lee and other employees had developed. This TeX Hour
celebrates this important anniversary.

History, someone said, is a foreign country. For those born in this
century some aspects of life in 1993 are close to
incomprensible. Mostly, to speak with someone remotely you had to dial
the number for the place you thought you they might be. That might be
a public call box!

In 1903 flying machines were similarly incomprensible. The Wright
Flyer caused a sensation when it came to New York in 1909. (This was
44 years after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.) And 30 years on
from 1903 air travel was a reality, at least for some, and many people
used air-mail for its speed (and despite its expense).

Today it is incomprehensible that to send information to someone in
another continent you would

* create a physical object (an aerogramme)
* and then move that object across the world (the postal service)
* hoping that you've got the correct address for the person

Even the highly condensed DVD (4.7BG each) finds it difficult to
compete with electronic transfer of information. It used to be that
telegraphy was much more expensive than post. It is now snail-mail
that is the luxury item. Today, you'd just arrange a video meeting!

The World Wide Web is central to that change. It has energy. The most
common form now of written communication is to put information on a
web server. Once down, those who want it (and who are permitted) can
retrieved to wherever they happen to be. The web pages fly around the
world. Well, much faster than fly. Seconds to cross the Atlantic.

For the TeX community, remember that print started as an economical
way of making multiple copies of information. It's much cheaper than
copying it out by hand. It still is cheap to print many copies. It's
the distribution, which depends on the physical movement of things,
that is expensive. And many people view PDF is in web browser.

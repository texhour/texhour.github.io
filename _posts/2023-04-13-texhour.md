### Summary

**Jonathan Fine** `latex` is a program that compiles a source document
to a PDF document. I'm writing `unlatex` as a program that goes in the
other direction. I'm doing this with a view to
* Intercepting the creation of PDF to produce more accessible outputs.
* Adding information just before the creation of the PDF to produce tagged PDF.
* Providing high-quality regression tests for changes in macros and other inputs.

More information about `unlatex` will be added prior to this TeX Hour.


This TeX Hour contributes to the success of the [Arxiv Accessibility
Forum (arxiv)](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html)
on Monday 17 April.

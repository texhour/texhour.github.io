### Summary


**Jonathan Fine**

The arXiv contains over 2.5 million STEM articles, most written in
LaTeX. This TeX Hour is a small contribution to improving the
rendering of archived articles. The focus is on the backlog.

The arXiv accessibility forum earlier this month was a big step. The
arXiv intends to publish the HTML generated by the ar5iv project,
alongside the PDF created by LaTeX. This gives a rough parity of
esteem between PDF and HTML. And it gives approval to rendering tools
outside TeXLive.

I've been poking around on ar5iv, hoping to learn and contribute. At
the TeX Hour I'll report of what I've learnt, what I've done, and how
you can contribute. (Few special skills beyond knowledge of TeX
required.)

A second topic for this TeX Hour will be an outline of the evolving
architecture of my `unlatex` project, if time permits. The focus there
is making the use of the document analysis and conversion tools more
accessible.

Some of the videos from the arXiv forum are now available.

### Summary

**Jonathan Fine** The arXiv is the world's pre-eminent math, physics
and computer science preprint server. It's where articles are
available before, and after, they've been published by a journal. It
contains about 2 million articles, most of which written in LaTeX and
rendered to PDF. This TeX Hour is about the arXiv providing accessible
HTML as well as the usual PDF.

### The arXiv Access Report and Forum

PDF is not good for accessible content, particularly when math is
involves. The arXiv has a major project to improve matters, whose
[Access
Report](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_research_report.html)
states:

> Based on our user research the step our community wants arXiv to
  take is clear: offer well formatted, accessible HTML alongside
  existing sources.

On Monday 17 April 2023, the arXiv is holding an Accessibility Forum,
as part their access project. This will be the most important and best
attended meeting related to the future of TeX for several years.

Please consider signing up for the arXiv [Accessibility
Forum](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html). It's
actually much more important than the TeX Hour on 30 March. But if
you're a geek, go to both.

### Helping the arXiv

The Access Tree is a key concept in accessibility of computer software
and electronic documents. It is the virtual tree provided to
screen-readers and other accessibility tools, which provides an
interface suitable for the blind and visually impaired, as well as
those with motor disabilities, such as weakness of muscle strength or
control.

The arXiv has started a large and important project. They need and
deserve our help and support. This TeX Hour will is about creating a
technical architecture overview of the various methods of creating an
Access Tree (via HTML) and high-quality PDF from a single source,
probably LaTeX.

This TeX Hour will be recorded, to make it available to others. If
you'd like to contribute to the overview come along. You'll be able to
make a brief presentation.

### Thanks

Much of the content and motivation for this TeX Hour arose from an
in-person conversation with Kaveh Bazargan, who will be a breakout
panellist at the Accessibility Forum. Kaveh's company [River
Valley](https://rivervalley.io/) sponsor the TeX Hour by paying for
its Zoom license.

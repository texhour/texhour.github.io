### Summary

**Jonathan Fine** The arXiv is the world's pre-eminent math, physics
and computer science preprint server. Recently they published an
Accessibility Report. This is a very important document for the future
of TeX in math, physics and computer science research and publication.

Monday 17 April 2023 is the date of the arXiv Accessibility Forum (1pm
to 5pm Eastern Time - US). This TeX Hour will allow those interested
to gain a shared understanding of the Access Report prior to attending
the Access Forum.

All are welcome to both the arXiv Forum (register first) and the TeX
Hour. You'll get more benefit, and contribute more, if you read the
report prior to the meeting. But if you don't, you'll still be
welcome.

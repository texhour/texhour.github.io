The New Year is an opportunity to reconsider, renew and resolve. This
is true both for individuals and groups. Please bring your TeX related
wishes and predictions. And if you wish, you can share your
resolutions.

All are welcome. TeX related includes communication, publishing,
society and technology, so long as the contribution is relevant and
helpful to the community.

Further information will appear on this page as available.

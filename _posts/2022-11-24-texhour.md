This meeting coincides with with Thanksgiving lunch for many of our
attendees in the USA. To avoid conflict with this important event in
social and family life this TeX Hour is also a social event.

Those who come might wish to reflect on the debt we owe as TeX users
to many causes and conditions, including persons both alive and also
no longer living.

This meeting will not be recorded.

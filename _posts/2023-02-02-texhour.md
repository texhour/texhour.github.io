### The meeting

**Jonathan Fine:** Tonight's combination might look a bit odd. But it
makes sense. We look at the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
(OIES)](https://oeis.org/) from the point of view of Digital
Typography. A humanist might look at the [First Folio
(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Folio) of
Shakespeare's plays from the point of view of 17th century movable
type printing.

All of us know some integer sequences. The counting numbers. The
powers of ten. Perhaps the prime numbers. Perhaps Pascal's triangle of
binomial coefficients. All these are in the OEIS, along with about
350,000 other sequences of more or less interest.

The OEIS was founded by Neil Sloane as first a collection of punch
cards (1965) and then books (1973, 1995), and then became a website
(1996). From 2002 it became a community with associate editors and
volunteers.

The OEIS is a sort of social networking site for mathematicians. If
the same sequence appears in two places then there's probably a
connection of sorts. So the OEIS is a sort of social networking site
for mathematicians.

For example, quite by chance I found that my research was connected to
the [Kolakoski sequence (OEIS A000002)](https://oeis.org/A000002). The
links in that page allow me to link up with others who value that
sequence. By the way, the OEIS contains (as a joke) a program to
generate the Kolakoski sequence [in the Shakespeare programming
language](https://oeis.org/A000002/a000002.spl.txt).

And now we can get to Digital Typography, by which I mean largely the
art and science on presenting textual information in print, web-page,
audio and other media. The online life of OEIS is in some started with
the copying into web pages of the contents of Neil Sloane's file
cabinets.

Digital typography has nothing to do with fingers and thumbs, just as
a Digital Camera gets its name from the Latin _camera_ (meaning
'room'). In this TeX Hour, _Digital Typography_ will mean studying the
media and conventions used by the OEIS and its team of volunteers.

In particular we'll look at some of the about 3,130 [annotated scanned
copies
(Google)](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aoeis.org+annotated+scanned+copy)
in the OEIS. Many seem to have come from the Sloane's file
cabinet. For me, a Digital Typography is part of the publishing of a
Digital File Cabinet.

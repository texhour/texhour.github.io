### Summary


**Jonathan Fine** Last month I attended an excellent half-day workshop on
_Creating accessible online mathematics and statistics notes_. The
videos are now available. This TeX Hour will be a review of the
workshop, based on the videos and other resources.

TALMO stands for _Teaching And Learning Mathematics Online_. It's an
organisation of teachers of maths and stats in UK universities. It was
set up during the Covid-19 pandemic to share resources and avoid
wasteful duplication. It continues to this day.

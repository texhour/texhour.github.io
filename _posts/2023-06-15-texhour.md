### Summary


**Jonathan Fine** Last month I attended an excellent half-day workshop on
_Creating accessible online mathematics and statistics notes_. The
videos are now available. This TeX Hour will be a review of the
workshop, based on the videos and other resources.

TALMO stands for _Teaching And Learning Mathematics Online_. It's an
organisation of teachers of maths and stats in UK universities. It was
set up during the Covid-19 pandemic to share resources and avoid
wasteful duplication. It continues to this day.

### The TeX Hour

Most of the talk was a review of the speakers at the workshop, based
on their home pages and similar resources. But first I gave a summary
of workshop program, so that we could relate topics to speakers. I
encourage you, before or after reading and viewing this page, to visit
the [TALMO page for the workshop](http://talmo.uk/) and watch their
the videos that interest you. That will strengthen the math and STEM
access community.

In particular, I suggest if nothing else you watch the video (and read
the slides) from Lilian Joy and students at York (see below for URLs).

## Summary


**Jonathan Fine** By the end of 2025 I'd like both the accessibility
and LaTeX communities to be working together to bring an end to
'separate-but-equal' production of electronic and print STEM
documents. This chasm caused difficulties. More and more writers,
readers and publishers know the cost of this unsolved problem.

MathJax is a brilliant example of how both sides benefit from
cooperation across the digital-print divide.  They achieve their
stated goal of "Beautiful and accessible math in all browsers".

The R-Markdown tool chain is a wonderful example of a community
creating multiple output formats from a single source. Output
documents presentations, websites and books. Output formats include
PDF, Beamer, and accessible HTML.

I want this TeX Hour to focus on what else can reduce the divide, and
encourage similar software, by the end of 2025. No proposal is too
small or large to be considered, provided we are realistic about what
can to done. More people knowing more about what's out there would be
a good start. I see LaTeX and web developers having a key role here.

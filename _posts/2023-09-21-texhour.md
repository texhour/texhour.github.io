## Summary

I'm delighted that this week Nelson Beebe will be describing BibTeX,
and problems he'd like to have solved by the end of 2025.

BibTeX is part of LaTeX. It's described even in Lamports 1994 LaTeX
book. Nelson has contributed a rigorous grammar for BibTeX and
friends, and pioneered the storage and retrieval of BibTeX records in
SQL databases. Crucial here is that BibTeX is flexible. Each record
can include fields relevant only for search and retrieval, which won't
appear in a citation.


Nelson finds the combination of BibTeX and SQL enormously valuable for
documenting publications in books and journals, and on specific
subjects, and by and about specific authors. He also contributes to
large shared libraries of BibTeX records.

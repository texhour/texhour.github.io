We explore Learning Platforms. Many years ago, even before the invention of the printing press in 1440, the book was a prominent learning platform. Euclid's Elements consists of 13 books, written about 300 BCE. A learning platform is a posh word for a library of digital interactive books. Let's ensure they're accessible to the visually impaired.

In late 2019 O'Reilly acquired katacoda.com because it was "a powerful solution for developing critical tech skills for the 2.8 million members of the O'Reilly learning platform". Last month O'Reilly announced that public use of katacoda.com will end, and that the site will be shuttered on June 15 (a week from today).

### Summary


**Jonathan Fine**

The arXiv has about 2.5 million articles, most of which have been
processed with LaTeX to produce PDF. In addition, most of these LaTeX
articles have been processed with LaTeXML, to produce HTML. Recently
the arXix has announced it will be making this HTML available, to
improve accessibility. This TeX Hour is about using LaTeXML to
accessibility audit the arXiv LaTeX source.

LaTeXML produces a log file, containing warnings and errors. It
provides to some degree an accessibility audit of the LaTeX source
files on the arXiv. Tomorrow's TeX Hour is an informal preliminary
report on my efforts to use thes log files to audit arXiv source for
accessibility. Results so far are outnumbered by problems, but it's
early days.

Going to <https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/feeling_lucky> will send you to
a random arXiv article in HTML. At the bottom of that page there is a
link to the LaTeX-to-HTML conversion report (the log file), and also
the arXiv PDF. Getting the LaTeX source is more work. Automating all
this is one of the early problems.

**Jonathan Fine**: On Thursday I'll report on some accessibility
investigations. I'd like to see a general purpose tool that writes
accessible HTML. I might have to write it myself, but I hope not.

My starting point will be looking at examples of accessible pages and
understanding their underlying HTML. I hope this will help me
understand what's needed in the HTML, to make it accessible.

A tool that writes simple accessible tables and which is extensible
would be an interesting intermediate goal. Small enough to be
practical, large enough to show difficulties, and common enough to be
important. Perhaps such a tool already exists, and perhaps I can find
it.

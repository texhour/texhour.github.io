Sometime soon, I hope, we'll be easily able to generate accessible
HTML5 and tagged PDF from LaTeX documents. How to write our TeX source
documents and personal macros so that they're ready for these
important developments, when they become available?

The focus here will be on TeX macros, by which I mean both the
backslash commands that are in the source document and the '@' macros
that for use only in style files. This TeX Hour will for newcomers
start with an introduction to TeX macros.

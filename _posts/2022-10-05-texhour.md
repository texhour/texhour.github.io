Sometime soon, I hope, we'll be easily able to generate accessible
HTML5 and tagged PDF from LaTeX documents. How to write our TeX source
documents and personal macros in a way makes them ready for these
important developments, when they become available?

The focus here will be on TeX macros, by which I mean both the
backslash commands that are in the source document and the '@' macros
that for use only in style files. This TeX Hour will for newcomers
start with an introduction to TeX macros.

### Summary

**Jonathan Fine** This TeX Hour looked at Typst, a new project in
technical typsetting. Typst has the production of HTML (and hence
accessible outputs) as a central goal.

Typst uses a modern input syntax and a Rust core to create a tool that
will be easier to use. I learned about it from a post to the BlindMath
mailing list.

This meeting was not recorded.

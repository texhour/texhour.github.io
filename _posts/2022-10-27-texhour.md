### Background

**Jonathan Fine**: Git is the version control system developed by
Linus Torvalds to host the development of Linux. Famously, Torvalds
says he developed only two pieces of software and he named them both
after themself. These items are Linux and Git.

Fossil SCM deserves to be better known. Richard Hipp developed both
SQLite and Fossil (and named neither after himself). The one is 'SQL
for the browser' and the other an 'all-in-one' platform for version
control, bug tracking and wiki. Fossil hosts SQLite development.

Both Git and Fossil are peer-to-peer Distributed Version Control
Systems. I know Git well, and am new to Fossil. I expect to find that
each has advantages over the other.

### This TeX Hour

In this TeX Hour I'll show you some of the unusual things I'm doing
with Git (such as using it solely as an object store) and what I've
discovered between now and then about Fossil.

This TeX Hour connects quite nicely to last week's [Same inputs via
the XML Catalog]({% post_url 2022-10-20-texhour %}). That TeX Hour was
about using a Git object store instead of files on disk, via an entity
Resolver (which is an XML concept).

### Diversions

For TeX enthusiasts, the Fossil Users Guide is available in both HTML
(of course) and rather nice looking PDF. This sort of thing
help's keep TeX relevant and up-to-date. And it communicates print
document structure traditions to the new world of web browsers and
HTML.

Finally, this year's Nobel Prize for went to Svante Pääbo "for his
discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human
evolution". Or in other words, the study of Fossils. The prize
committee Chair said "Over the years to come this will give us huge
insights into human physiology."

So well done and thank you, Svante Pääbo.

### Summary

**Jonathan Fine** This is an informal personal talk about the
influence of accessibility on a math research problem, and vice
versa. The problem is to define something like Pascal's triangle, but
with the rows summing to the Fibonacci numbers. Such I call a
Fibonacci wedding cake, as it is an elaborate tower made out of
multiple tiers.

Here's something that surprised me. Pascal's triangle can be presented
in several ways. For a sighted person the usual way (using Markdown)
is:

||||| 1 |
|||| 1 || 1 |
||| 1 || 2 || 1 |
|| 1 || 3 || 3 || 1 |
| 1 || 4 || 6 || 3 || 1 |

The suprise was the thought that for a blind person (again in
Markdown) this left-aligned form might be much better.

| 1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 1 |

I'd very much welcome any feedback on access to number
triangles. Although the Fibonacci wedding cake is connected to some
advanced topics, no special knowledge of pure math is required for
this talk. Just an interesting in learning about and discovering
patterns.

### Summary


**Jonathan Fine**

The papers on the arXiv, mostly written in LaTeX, are an important
sample of current practice. This TeX Hour will gather questions worth
asking about the arXiv papers, that can easily be answered by using
software to process these papers. Your questions are welcome.

### Summary


**Jonathan Fine** This TeXHour provides an overview of NumFOCUS, a
well-supported public charity for open source scientific
computing. Beside scientific computing, it also sponsors MathJax,
which is a browser based math typesetting system.

NumFOCUS was founded in 2012. It has important symbiosis with the
PyData conference series. MathJax is a JavaScript library for
displaying and making accessible mathematics on web pages. Since 2019
MathJax has been a NumFOCUS Sponsored Project.

This TeX Hour will focus on the human side of NumFOCUS, and in
particular the financial, organisation and social support it provides
for the open source scientific computing.

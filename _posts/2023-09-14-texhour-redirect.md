### Introduction to series

Here's a general introduction to the 2025 series of meetings.

**Jonathan Fine** A community solving shared problems is important,
both for open source software and more widely. This week I'd like to
gather problems that might be solved in the next 3 to 15 months. In
other words, by the end of 2025. Put another way, by the end of the
first quarter of the 21st century. Extra points for problems from last
century that can be solved by 2025!

All problems related to text, math, documents, command line interfaces
and in particular accessibility.

Pedantry alert. Wikipedia and the Library of Congress state that the
21st century started on 1 January 2001.

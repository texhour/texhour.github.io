It's now about two years and 100 meetings since the TeX Hour
started. Time to celebrate this event, to look back and to look
forward.

Also time to bring the archives and video recordings into better
order. So while this is a party meeting, there's also work to be done.

All are welcome. Bring your own ~~refreshments~~ agenda.

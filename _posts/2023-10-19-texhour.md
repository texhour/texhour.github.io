## Summary

**Jonathan Fine** We'll discuss and perhaps start creating a set
theory cheat sheet. The result will be published on the TeX Hour
website, via the Quarto publishing system for STEM documents.

Quarto is a strong candidate for producing accessible outputs (as
HTML), particularly for blind users. Here are relevant links for that:

* [Tex Hour \| Quarto](https://texhour.github.io/quarto/)
* [Tex Hour \| Venn Diagrams](https://texhour.github.io/quarto/tmp/venn-diagrams-2023-10-17.html)

Most of the top ten set theory cheat sheets are PDF, and are not
accessible. Surely in 2023 we can do better than that. This Tex Hour
will have a go.

By the way, [Have a Go
(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_a_Go) was a BBC Radio
show that ran from 1946 to 1967.

Last month Jonathan Godfrey travelled from New Zealand to the UK, to
attend the 2023 R Project Sprint in person. He's still in the UK. He
was kind enough to invite me to meet with him after the sprint. Last
Sunday I met him at the University of Warwick, and we had several
hours getting to know each other better, and discussing matters such
as:

* The importance of community
* The R Journal moving to HTML
* Creating HTML from the LaTeX source for R documentation
* The arXiv accessibility initiative
* For R, a browser-based REPL (read print eval loop)

At Thursday's TeX Hour Jonathan G and I will review and continue our conversation, and you are invited to listen and also join in if you wish. I'm looking forward to this.

In case you didn't know, Jonathan G is a blind senior lecturer in Statistics at Massey University, New Zealand. He's also a proficient R user, who prepares teaching materials using R-Markdown.

We meet most Thursdays, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time (in winter GMT, in
summer BST). For more details and Zoom URL see [the About
page](about).

### Accessibility

We're delighted with the well-deserved success of the arXiv

the future of TeX and LaTeX. For more information see our
[Accessibility](access) page.
